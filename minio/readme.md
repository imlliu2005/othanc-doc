### Purpose
This is a sample setup to demonstrate how to run Orthanc with an AWS S3 storage that is simulated by minio.

### Starting the setup
To start the setup, type: docker-compose up --build -d and docker-compose logs to access the logs later on.

Before you upload any DICOM file in Orthanc, connect to the minio interface (minio/miniopwd) and create a my-sample-bucket bucket. Also make sure to edit the Policy to Read-Write.

### demo
Orthanc is accessible on http://localhost:8042. If you upload data to Orthanc, everything will be stored in the minio storage.
